# Salesforce GitHub Actions `CumulusCi`

This repository serves as an effort to preserve and enhance public access to the Cumulus Suite GitHub Actions framework. It was created to ensure continued availability of these capabilities while introducing complementary workflows, upgrades, and improvements.

## Purpose

- Maintain unfettered public access to Cumulus Suite GitHub Actions
- Introduce complementary workflows and upgrades
- Provide a centralized location for accessing and contributing to these resources

## Background

- The [original `SalesforceFoundation` organization](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation) recently introduced IP-whitelist restrictions, limiting public access to their resources. This repository aims to preserve the legacy of CumulusCI Actions and Flows, ensuring continued public usage for managing the development and extension of NPSP, EDA, and their dependencies.

- While [the original `cumulus-actions` organization](https://github.com/cumulus-actions) remains publicly accessible, this project serves multiple purposes:
  1. Mitigate the risk of potential future access restrictions
  2. Provide a centralized hub for all original capabilities
  3. Introduce and maintain our own improvements and extensions to the framework

- By consolidating these resources and innovations, we aim to create a robust, community-driven platform for Cumulus Suite GitHub Actions.
